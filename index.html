            <h3>Missile Man of India</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Born on 15th October 1931 at Rameswaram in 
                Tamil Nadu, Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul 
                Kalam, specialized in Aeronautical Engineering 
                from Madras Institute of Technology.</b> Dr. Kalam made 
                significant contribution as Project Director to
                 develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle 
                    (SLV-III) which successfully injected the Rohini satellite
                     in the near earth orbit in July 1980 and made India an exclusive
                      member of Space Club. He was responsible for the evolution 
                      of ISRO's launch vehicle programme, particularly the PSLV 
                      configuration. After working for two decades in ISRO and mastering 
                      launch vehicle technologies, Dr. Kalam took up the responsibility of developing Indigenous Guided 
                      Missiles at Defence Research and Development Organisation as the Chief Executive
                       of Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP). He was responsible
                        for the development and operationalisation of AGNI and PRITHVI Missiles and
                         for building indigenous capability in critical technologies through networking
                          of multiple institutions. He was the Scientific Adviser to Defence Minister
                           and Secretary, Department of Defence Research & Development from
                            July 1992 to December 1999. During this period he led to the weaponisation
                            of strategic missile systems and the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in collaboration
                            with Department of Atomic Energy, which made India a nuclear weapon State.
                            He also gave thrust to self-reliance in defence systems by progressing multiple
                            development tasks and mission projects such as Light Combat Aircraft.
                As Chairman of Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC) and 
                as an eminent scientist, he led the country with the help of 500 experts to arrive at 
                Technology Vision 2020 giving a road map for transforming India from the present developing
                 status to a developed nation. Dr. Kalam has served as the Principal Scientific Advisor to the
                  Government of India, in the rank of Cabinet Minister, from November 1999 to November 2001 and
                   was responsible for evolving policies, strategies and missions for many development
                    applications. Dr. Kalam was also the Chairman, Ex-officio, of the Scientific Advisory 
                    Committee to the Cabinet (SAC-C) and piloted India Millennium Mission 2020.</p>
